== Description ==

Child theme for TwentySixteen. 
WCD Baby Sixteen has added basic yet stylish flat buttons, and a more delicate feel without the bold lines and borders 
present in the original Twenty Sixteen theme.
On desktop the main navigation bar is sticky, mobile menu "hamburger" button moved to centre of the screen for improved UI experience for left/right handed users.
When custom logo is added, both the site title and description are removed from the header navigation bar.
Footer copyright text is dynamic for the site and date. Is also now centred and discretely located at the very bottom of the page.
