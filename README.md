# wcdbabysixteen
A child theme for the "twentysixteen" WordPress theme by Automatic. 

== Description ==
Child theme for TwentySixteen. 
WCD Baby Sixteen has added basic yet stylish flat buttons, and a more delicate feel without the bold lines and borders 
present in the original Twenty Sixteen theme.

== Important Note ==
